Description: The goal of `val` is to create a unit testing culture for data cleaning tasks using R. `val` could enable R users to specify table schema without knowing JSON, YAML, SQL, and designing a database. Users would create schema objects from `val` and work towards the detailed schema until their data has passed the validation.
